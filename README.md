# Recommender-System-MovieLens-dataset

## EPFL CS-449 Project : Personalized Recommender with k-NN:
In this project, we progressively build a recommender system for Movies. We start by implementing a simple baseline prediction for recommendation then distribute it with Spark. We then compare the quality of its predictions to a second personalized approach based on similarities and k-NN. We measure the CPU time to develop insights in the system costs of the prediction methods.
